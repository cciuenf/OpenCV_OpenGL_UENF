My Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) programs ,
and my OpenGL programs ... or my experiments with both of them at the same
time.

First experiment :
    Rotating a WireSphere in OpenGL with hand tracking (.xml).
    Testing perfomance.

    Testing false positives frequency.

Third experiment :
    Experience and test Color tracking.
    Simple in theory , but a lot more complicated in real-life ...
