My Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) programs ,
and my OpenGL programs ... or my experiments with both of them at the same
time.

First experiment :
    Rotating a WireSphere in OpenGL with hand tracking (.xml).
    Testing perfomance.

Second experiment :
    Paint a pixel in x,y position with hand tracking (.xml).
    Testing false positives frequency.

Third experiment :
    Experience and test Color tracking.
    Simple in theory , but a lot more complicated to use in real-life because of light conditions.

Fourth experiment :
    First attempt to experience PyGame lib using OpenCV's
    detection results to control an object's animation.
